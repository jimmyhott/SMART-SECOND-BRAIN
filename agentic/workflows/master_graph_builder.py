"""
Master Graph Builder for Smart Second Brain LangGraph Workflows.

This module implements the core workflow orchestration system for the Smart Second Brain
project. It defines a comprehensive LangGraph workflow that handles both document
ingestion and knowledge querying through a series of interconnected nodes.

Key Workflows:
1. Document Ingestion: raw_document -> chunking -> embedding -> storage
2. Knowledge Query: user_input -> retrieval -> generation -> validation -> storage

Core Components:
- StateGraph: LangGraph workflow definition with conditional routing
- Node Methods: Individual processing steps for each workflow stage
- Checkpointing: Memory-based state persistence for conversation continuity
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms

Architecture:
- Router Node: Determines workflow path based on query_type
- Ingestion Branch: Document processing and storage pipeline
- Query Branch: Knowledge retrieval and answer generation pipeline
- Human Review: Human-in-the-loop validation and feedback
- Validated Storage: Persistent storage of approved answers

Dependencies:
- LangGraph: Workflow orchestration and state management
- LangChain: Text processing, embeddings, and LLM integration
- ChromaDB: Vector database for document storage and retrieval
- Azure OpenAI: Embedding generation and language model interactions

    Main workflow orchestrator for Smart Second Brain knowledge processing.
    
    This class builds and manages the LangGraph workflow that handles both
    document ingestion and knowledge querying. It encapsulates all node

    The workflow supports two main paths:
    1. Document Ingestion: Processes new documents into the knowledge base
    2. Knowledge Query: Retrieves and generates answers from stored knowledge
    
    Key Features:
    - Conditional workflow routing based on query type
    - Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
    - Human-in-the-loop review and validation
    - Persistent state management with checkpointing
    - Flexible integration with various LLM and embedding providers
